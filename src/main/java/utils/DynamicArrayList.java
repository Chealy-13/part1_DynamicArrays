//Your dynamic array list should include a constructor that lets the user specify by how much the list
// should expand each time it runs out of space in its internal array. The constructor should take in
// one parameter, an int that specifies the expansion factor to be used.
// The supplied value should be validated, and invalid values handled accordingly.

//      AN EXTRA ADD
//    Your list should contain a method called add() that takes two parameters:
//    A String to be added (this may be null).
//    A position at which to insert the data.

//    The position should be validated and invalid positions handling accordingly. If the position is valid,
//    the data from that position should be added to the list using shift insertion.
//    If there is insufficient space in the list, the internal array should be
//    grown (using the arraycopy method from Javaâ€™s API OR your own growArray algorithm) and
//    the String added then. If supplied, null values should be added.
//    The method should return nothing.


//      A REMOVE
//Your list should contain a method called remove() that takes two parameters:
//    The String to be removed (This should not be null).
//    An int indicating the position from which to start the removal process.
//    The first instance of this String found starting at the specified position should be
//    removed from the list. The method should return a boolean indicating if an instance
//    of the String was removed.


//    A RANDOM OTHER FEATURE
//Your list should contain a method called clear() that takes no parameters and returns nothing.
// This method should wipe the content of the array and reset it back to the initial size.
